Knowledge:
  Stores if UNSAT known
  Stores if SAT known
  Stores known assignments to variables
  Stores known 2-consistencies
  Function to add assignment which updates 2-consistencies
  Function to add 2-consistencies which updates 2-consistencies
  Can merge with other Knowledge

DNF:
  Stores the list of variables in a function
  Stores the assignments that result in this function being true
  Can use Knowledge to modify self
  Can create Knowledge by examining self
  <Implementation>
  Store variables in vector
  Store assignments as rows of assignments, where the column indicates what variable
  To remove a variable, for each row swap column to end and pop
  To remove assignment, swap row to end and pop

Problem:
  Stores the collection of DNFs in the problem
  Stores global Knoweldge
  Stores variable-to-DNF mapping
  Stores which DNFs have been modified since last assume-and-learn
  <Implementation>
  vector<shared_ptr<DNF>> is the current problem
  variable-to-DNF is vector<weak_ptr<DNF>>
  Any set of DNFs that need to be processed can be unordered_set<weak_ptr<DNF>>
